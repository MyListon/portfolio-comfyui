# ðŸŽ¨ AI Portfolio with ComfyUI

This repository brings together my creative experiments using ComfyUI for image generation with Stable Diffusion.

Here you'll find both the visual results and the workflows and prompts I used in the process.

âœ¨ **Description:**
Creation of a surrealist scene, where glass bottles contain natural landscapes and vivid colors. The goal was to explore the fusion between everyday objects and fantastical environments.

ðŸ”§ **Technical Details:** 
- **Tool:** ComfyUI 
- **Template Used:** Stable Diffusion 1.5 (v1-5-pruned-emaonly.ckpt) 
- **Prompt (example):**
---

- **Configuration (log summary):** 
- CLIP/Text encoder on `torch.float16` 
- VAE on `torch.float32` 
- GPU execution (CUDA:0)

## ðŸš€ How to reproduce this project
1. Open **ComfyUI** and load the workflow saved in `workflows/bottles.json` (or create a similar workflow).
2. Adjust `CheckpointLoaderSimple` to use a local SD 1.5 model.
3. Run and generate your own variations!
